  "Hello, my name is Enrico",
  "Many novice writers tend to make a sharp distinction between content and style, thinking that a paper can be strong in one and weak in the other, but focusing on organization shows how content and style converge in deliberative academic writing. Your professors will view even the most elegant prose as rambling and tedious if there isn’t a careful, coherent argument to give the text meaning. Paragraphs are the “stuff ” of academic writing and, thus, worth our attention here.",
  "Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence through an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There are a number of useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your ideas in a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports a general statement by means of examples, details, or relevant quotations (with your comments).",
  "A series of long paragraphs can make prose dense and unpleasant to read. Check any paragraph that is a page or longer to see whether it would work better as two or more paragraphs. Break it at a logical place (e.g., where your focus shifts), and see whether you need to create new topic sentences to make the shift clear.",
  "Also look out for short paragraphs only two or three sentences long. They make academic writing seem disjointed or skimpy. Try combining short paragraphs with the preceding or following paragraph if they share the same topic. Short paragraphs might also need to be developed further. Make sure that nothing vital has been omitted.",
  "Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field. For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.",
  'Science has no single origin. Rather, scientific methods emerged gradually over the course of thousands of years, taking different forms around the world, and few details are known about the very earliest developments. Some of the earliest evidence for scientific reasoning is tens of thousands of years old, and women likely played a central role in prehistoric science, as did religious rituals. Some Western authors have dismissed these efforts as "protoscientific"',
  "The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as Episkyros or phaininda, which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria. These games appear to have resembled rugby football. The Roman politician Cicerodescribes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis. Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.",
  "Every age differs in its ability to store, create, and transmit information. Today, we are living in the computer age. The diffusion of digital technology has made it easier than ever to fulfill the basic communicative tasks on which civilization depends. In keeping with this evolution, demand for typing proficiency has risen exponentially during the last 20 years. Whereas typing was once a luxury, it is now a basic life skill that all modern people have an interest in developing.",
  "The next fast typing lessons will be about typing common words on the keyboard. Why are these words in the lessons? Because they are most common in a given language, so by practicing typing on these words, you program your muscles so that they can type a given word quickly and without errors. This is similar to fast reading, or rather global reading. In this technique you do not focus on individual letters, but looking at the word you know its meaning. Your muscles will remember the keys sequence needed to form a word.",
  "Take English for example. It is estimated that we have over 170,000 words in English. As a rule, a native speaker in a given language uses between 15,000 and 20,000 word families. A variation of a given word can be modified by tenses, in some languages ​​by modes, cases, or persons is counted as one word, therefore it belongs to the same family. The truth is, language learners who learn for a long period of time know only 2-3000 word families. Research shows that in order to speak a language effectively, you need to know about a thousand families of words that are most common in a given language. Knowledge of eight hundred words gives a spoken language understanding of 75%.",
